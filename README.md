<h3>FairDAO</h3>

DeFi DAOs say they're decentralized but actually have concentration of governance tokens with developers, investors, and whales.
To truly decentralize and have diverse voices, a new DAO voting mechanism was created that uses voting uniqueness scores determined by a Machine Learning algorithm

<h3>The Working:</h3>
The project uses ML to determine each voter's "uniqueness score" in DAO proposals. Data is stored securely on Filecoin IPFS & read by smart contracts via Chainlink oracles. The score, from 0 to 100, reflects a voter's pattern of voting based on proposal type, determined by a ML clustering algorithm.
