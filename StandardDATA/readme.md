# FairDAO

FairDAO is a voting mechanism which uses machine learning to assign each voter a uniqueness score.


## Features
- Uses machine learning to assign each voter a uniqueness score.
- Filecoin IPFS allows us to store the input data, intermediate ML model outputs and uniqueness scores assigned to each user for each DAO proposal vote with provable authenticity and Chainlink oracles external adapter allow us to read the data using a smart contract.
- Voter uniqueness is based on the type of proposal as determined by a Machine Learning clustering algorithm. Voter weights (also termed uniqueness scores) range from 0 to 100, and are calculated based on the voterâ€™s composition of voting patterns.
