IN SHORT: (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhJtmUqhAqg)
1. GovernanceToken : who owns how many votes
2. timelock : is the owner, says who can propose (GovernorContract) for changes in Box, 
   and when can these changes (on Box) actually be executed
3. GovernorContract: voting logic (e.g. count votes based of GovernanceToken allocation, check if vote passed)
4. Box : is the contract whose owner is the timelock (you need to vote to change state values)

 DEPLOYMENT STEPS:
 1. Deploy governance token (ERC20Votes):
 INPUTS: none
    a. no owner, fixed supply
    b. This extension (ERC20Votes) keeps a history (checkpoints) of each account's vote power. Vote power can be delegated either
       by calling the {delegate} function directly, or by providing a signature to be used with {delegateBySig}. Voting
       power can be queried through the public accessors {getVotes} and {getPastVotes}.
    c. By default, token balance does not account for voting power. This makes transfers cheaper. The downside is that it
       requires users to delegate to themselves in order to activate checkpoints and have their voting power tracked.
 2. Deploy timelock contract (is the owner of everything)
 - INPUTS: just set a MIN_DELAY, and provide empty lists of proposers, and executors (will populate later)
 - the proposer will become the governor contract
 - the executor can be anyone
    a. Contract module which acts as a timelocked controller. When set as the
  owner of an `Ownable` smart contract, it enforces a timelock on all
  `onlyOwner` maintenance operations. This gives time for users of the
  controlled contract to exit before a potentially dangerous maintenance
  operation is applied.
  b. By default, this contract is self administered, meaning administration tasks
  have to go through the timelock process. The proposer (resp executor) role
  is in charge of proposing (resp executing) operations. A common use case is
  to position this {TimelockController} as the owner of a smart contract, with
  a multisig or a DAO as the sole proposer.
3. Deploy GovernorContract - for a quick setup go to openzeppelin contract wizard
INPUTS: governanceTokenContract.address, timeLockContract.address, VOTING_DELAY, 
        VOTING_PERIOD, QUORUM_PERCENTAGE
  a. This contract has all the voting logic 
      e.g. - A counting module must implement {quorum}, {_quorumReached}, {_voteSucceeded} and {_countVote}
           - A voting module must implement {_getVotes}
           - Additionanly, the {votingPeriod} must also be implemented
4. SETUP timeLockContract
 a. set governorContract for proposerRole
 b. set 0x00 for executorRole
 c. revoke adminRole of deployer's address for timeLockContract
5. Deploy Box (which is Ownable), and set timelock as owner
