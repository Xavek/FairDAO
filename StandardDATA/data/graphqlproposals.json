This will be exchanged for USDC via an agency desk in order to support critical DAO workstream funding needs. Any GTC that remains after the strategic diversification will be returned to the treasury. Given current market conditions and Gitcoin's operating needs, we think this is a prudent action to take.\n\n### State of GitcoinDAO\u2019s Treasury\n\nToday, GitcoinDAO\u2019s [treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x57a8865cfB1eCEf7253c27da6B4BC3dAEE5Be518) holds 23m GTC (roughly $57.1m). GitcoinDAO\u2019s [Treasury Vester](https://etherscan.io/address/0x44aa9c5a034c1499ec27906e2d427b704b567ffe) holds another 26m GTC which will be distributed to the DAO over time.\n\nThe vast majority of the DAO\u2019s treasury is held in GTC, with very little in stablecoins. At the end of May, the DAO held $280k in DAI and USDC.\n\n### Rationale for Exchange\n\nIndividual DAO workstreams have been funded in GTC and are now facing an asset-liability mismatch. Many contributors have wages denominated in USD terms, yet workstreams only have GTC with which to pay said contributors. With the market downturn, workstreams now face an increased risk of not being able to meet these obligations. We wanted to quickly ensure that workstreams can meet their obligations.\n\nWe\u2019re engaging with a reputable agency desk to execute this transaction. The agency desk will utilize a broad range of liquidity sources to execute the transaction with approximately 10 bps of slippage or less. The agency desk will charge 20 bps as a fee and will likely be able to execute the transaction within 3 days. This will ensure that each workstream has the stables needed to meet near term expenses.\n\nWe\u2019ve proposed working with a trusted agency desk on the transaction as an alternative to requiring workstreams to sell GTC on the open market, which would be inefficient, costly, and operationally riskier.\n\n### Other Notes\n\nAny GTC that remains after these two actions will be sent back to the treasury.\n\n### Execution\n\nWe will create the on-chain proposal to transfer GTC from the treasury to a 5/6 multisig. Signers on the multisig will be the the following Gitcoin Stewards:\n\n* Kyle Weiss\n* Annika Lewis\n* Shreyas Hariharan\n* Kris\n* Simona\n* James / Fire Eyes\n\nA Snapshot proposal will be posted to Gitcoin\u2019s Snapshot for a community vote.

These include a new Memorandum of Association and Bylaws. These docs have been reviewed by community members (including friends at LexDAO, and our own legal counsel) without any objections, and at this time we believe they are ready to be submitted for approval and ratification. These documents generally direct the Foundation to carry out DAO governance decisions (per our governance process - see update below), subject to statutory or other legal limits. They also allow the Foundation or its subsidiaries to spend capital within its control (ie assets transferred, not the treasury) to advance protocol development until Grants 2.0 is operational and comply with legal and other core requirements (like establishing AML processes, hiring accounting firms, etc).\n\nAs part of the ratification of the updated governing documents for the Foundation, it will also become \u201cownerless\u201d, meaning it will have no shareholders to whom fiduciary duties or other obligations are owed (one shareholder was initially required to be able to form it under Cayman law) and instead will be able to act in accordance with DAO governance without any obligations to any equity holders.\n\nOperating as an ownerless foundation will, however, increase the complexity for KYC purposes, including anti-money laundering and sanctions laws compliance, and also for certain other diligence purposes and interactions with the real world. But we believe that any such inconvenience is a worthwhile trade-off to establish a structure and environment where the DAO can truly direct the development of the Foundation long term.\n\nIn addition to the Foundation, we have formed 3 subsidiaries to help protect the Foundation\u2019s assets and structure its interactions with the real world. One of these subsidiaries will be a holding company for Gitcoin trademarks and certain other intellectual property (such as our monorepo). The second subsidiary will serve as our primary operating entity and will be responsible for activities such as paying for our domain names, safeguarding and allocating our treasury per DAO governance, engaging and paying ordinary vendors (such as Google and AWS), and serving as the counterparty to DAO contributor agreements. For those contributing to the DAO, this also means you will have a contributor agreement that we hope will help offer more structure, clarity and protection to both you and the Foundation when you perform work on behalf of the DAO); and (iii) a third entity that was created to custody the Gitcoin Grants Multisig (mostly to handle KYC and AML).\n\nWe are in the process of formalizing a few external service providers, such as a KYC/AML compliance officer and an accounting firm and we will continue to retain external legal counsel for any legal needs and questions that arise. As with starting any new entity, there are legal reporting requirements and business functions that will need care and feeding. For now, I am taking care of those things but we may want to consider hiring an operations person to manage much of the day to day.\n\nDAO Updates:\nA new v3 of our governance process has been posted for commentary and we will ratify this as part of this vote. This ratification process will enable us to memorialize the adoption of a process we are largely already following. \n\nAsset Transfer Updates:\nGitcoin Holdings is aligned with our interest in taking formal legal ownership of the various assets mentioned above (e.g. our Treasury, smart contracts, trademarks, SaaS contracts we need to operate) we as a community have created/maintained or advanced or need to grow so that they can then focus on revenue and delivering the best hackathon experience possible for those partners who entrust them to grow their communities (for simplicity, I refer to these as our Assets). This means that Gitcoin Holdings will be transferring these Assets to us, as well as some additional capital to ensure the Foundation and subsidiaries can pay their operating costs for some time and run as an independent and decentralized enterprise (which also solves certain legal capitalization requirements).\n\nSince Hackathons is built on the Gitcoin brand, Gitcoin Holdings will be granted a temporary license to use Gitcoin trademarks until they reestablish operations under a new name, and I imagine we will continue to share a community for some time.", "choices": ["Yes - Ratify the changes", "No - Do not ratify the changes"], "start": 1655316000, "end": 1655748000, "snapshot": "14968731", "state": "closed", "author": "0xc2E2B715d9e302947Ec7e312fd2384b5a1296099", "space": {"id": "gitcoindao.eth", "name": "Gitcoin"}}, {"id": "0x79e8ca9c2f8af4b606cbba35a478e9fc2080d48d1fd80300deeb63245a148768", "title": "Gitcoin // Radicle Public Goods Alliance", "body": "Forum post: https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-radicle-public-goods-alliance-temp-check/10825\n\n## Summary\n\nWe propose a Public Goods Alliance be formed between Gitcoin and Radicle. Gitcoin and Radicle will provide a mutual grant of their respective native tokens (GTC and RAD) to the partner DAO\u2019s treasury. Voting power from these tokens will be delegated to multisigs controlled by the partner DAO. Gitcoin will receive a range of RAD (dependent upon the final grant rate) and Radicle will receive 500,000 GTC, making both DAOs top 10 delegates in one another\u2019s governance [1]. \n\n### Context \n[Llama](https://llama.xyz) builds economic infrastructure for DAOs. We are an opinionated layer on top of DeFi protocols that helps DAOs take treasury actions including treasury diversification, liquidity provisioning, token swaps, and more. As part of our goal to grow the DAO economy, Llama has engaged with key stakeholders from the Gitcoin (Scott) and Radicle (Abbey) communities to propose a Public Goods Alliance. We presented our plan to Gitcoin\u2019s Mutual Grants Committee and, after incorporating feedback from the committee, would now like to present the alliance to the broader Gitcoin community. You can view some of our work [here](https://llama.xyz/community). For more on Llama and our initiatives, see below. \n\n### Overview of Radicle \nRadicle is a decentralized code collaboration network built on open protocols, allowing developers to collaborate on code without trusting intermediaries. Radicle provides the benefits of a centralized code collaboration platform while retaining Git\u2019s peer-to-peer nature.\n\n## Purpose \nAs web3-native DAOs, Gitcoin and Radicle share similar missions of growing the public goods ecosystem. The Gitcoin and Radicle communities have rallied around this public goods mission and informally worked together over the last few years, co-hosting events and integrating Radicle in Kernel. In the future, Gitcoin and Radicle can benefit from more product integrations and a closer relationship.  As the two operate in similar spaces and have complementary focuses, Llama believes a formal Public Goods Alliance between the two DAOs would be mutually beneficial.  We view this alliance as a unique opportunity to formalize the partnership that has developed over the last few years by gaining a governance stake in each other\u2019s communities. The alliance will allow the communities to: \n* ***Collaborate on a shared vision through governance in each other\u2019s communities***: The mutual grant makes Gitcoin and Radicle major governance stakeholders in one another\u2019s communities. Each community will have influence in the other\u2019s governance process, enabling them to best represent their interests and to more closely collaborate on a shared open-source vision. \n* ***Develop synergistic features and products***: A formal partnership and vested token interest creates opportunity for closer collaboration on features and products that will benefit both communities. This could provide the necessary support for joint development on things such as using Radicle\u2019s decentralized identity for Gitcoin Grants and Gitcoin becoming a de facto funding mechanism for open source projects on Radicle. \n* ***Set precedent for future community alliances***: Both Gitcoin and Radicle\u2019s treasury strategies outline the basis for mutual grants and community collaborations being influential to the success of the protocols. This alliance can serve as a basis and provide the template for future collaborations for Gitcoin, Radicle, and the larger web3 ecosystem. In the future, and with alliance-member approval, more DAOs could be brought into the alliance. \n* ***Diversify each DAO\u2019s governance base***: Today, the distribution of voting power at both DAOs is concentrated in the hands of internal contributors. Both DAOs would benefit from a more diverse voter base, especially one that includes a like-minded partner DAO as one of its top stakeholders. To achieve this, Llama proposes that Gitcoin receive RAD (depending on final grant rate) and Radicle receive 500,000 GTC, formalizing the alliance between the two DAOs and making each DAO a top 10 delegate in each other\u2019s governance. \n\nAfter the proposal is executed, both DAOs agree to hold the others\u2019 tokens for a minimum of 2 years. \n\n## Proposed Voting Process \nTwo committees (one committee from each community) of 3 representatives will be chosen to focus on metagovernance in each community. 2 representatives will come from the respective community, while 1 representative will be from the Llama team. Community representatives should have a similar level of engagement as Gitcoin Stewards; they should have the context needed to make decisions on most proposals that Radicle is putting up for votes.  \n\nThe committees should vote independently, though the two should collaborate on joint governance proposals and initiatives relating to the strategic alliance. \n\nThe committee will be responsible for keeping track of all proposals in the other community and bringing them to their respective community for discussion. For each proposal, the committee will vote on behalf of their respective community, informed by their community\u2019s values, the goals of the Public Goods Alliance, and feedback from the broader community.  \n\nVotes will be executed out of a multisig controlled by the Metagovernance Committee. Upon receiving the mutual grant, the Treasury will automatically delegate votes to the multisig. \n\n## Reporting & Criteria for Success \nIn order to allow the communities to evaluate the success of the alliance, it\u2019s important to provide comprehensive, objective reporting on how the partnership is working. Reporting should be done on a monthly and quarterly basis to share results with both communities. Below are several ideas about how to gauge success of the alliance. \n* Governance  \n    * Participation rate in each other\u2019s governance votes \n    * Number of proposals posted in each other\u2019s forum by the committee  \n    * Number of comments posted in each other\u2019s forum by the committee  \n    * The impact of cross-governance participation, with a particular focus on the major or contentious proposals \n* Social  \n    * Number of co-sponsored events and their attendance  \n    * Community sentiment regarding the partnership and overall governance involvement (e.g. community members\u2019 willingness to hold the other protocol\u2019s tokens, voting on the other community\u2019s proposals) \n* Product  \n    * Number of development hours contributed to joint projects  \n    * Joint features / products / integrations shipped or in-flight \n\nThe quarterly review might include the above information and additionally report on: \n* Furthering Gitcoin and Radicle\u2019s primary mission  \n    * Whether and how the partnership has helped Gitcoin build and fund public goods on web3  \n    * Whether and how the partnership has helped Radicle develop resilient, peer-to-peer collaboration software \n* Collab / interoperability  \n    * Cross-community interoperability and its growth trajectory  \n    * Other synergies, or the lack thereof  \n\n## Ragequit Options \nIn the event that one party wants to reverse the deal after the mutual grant has been executed, Gitcoin and Radicle will need to strike a new agreement and run it through the governance process. Considering the operational complexities, compromise of the future roadmap, and damage of capital and goodwill the other community may endure, the party that initiates the reversal should reasonably expect less lenient terms, such as a partial return of the originally granted assets. Each DAO may choose to leave the alliance and return tokens within one month of the proposal being executed. \n\n## Ideas for Extensions of the Alliance \nWe view this mutual grant as just the beginning of a long alliance between Gitcoin and Radicle. In the future, we would like to explore more options to further the alliance. Several ideas include: \n* Gitcoin and Radicle commit funding to a jointly-governed pool and use it to advance public goods (grant programs, product development, etc.) \n* Having new public-goods-centric DAOs join the alliance \n\n## Asks from the Community \n*We are looking for 2 community members to serve on the Metagovernance Committee. If you are interested, please reach out to Scott or Dan.* \n\n--- \n\n ##### *[1] Source: [Radicle delegates](https://www.tally.xyz/governance/eip155:1:0x690e775361AD66D1c4A25d89da9fCd639F5198eD), [Gitcoin delegates](https://www.tally.xyz/governance/eip155:1:0xDbD27635A534A3d3169Ef0498beB56Fb9c937489).* \n\n--- \n## About Llama \nLlama is building economic infrastructure for DAOs.

By doing away with specific grant categories and having all grants listed together, we took a step towards simplifying and decentralizing matching. \n\nOn the whole, the Public Goods Funding workstream believes the experiment was a success \u2013 directionally, at the very least. We believe the experiment was helpful in getting funding to more grants without complaints from top earners, and allowed us to test our assumptions about removing categories.\n\nA statement from the PGF workstream:\n\nWe don\u2019t know for sure yet if the main pool approach works best long-term, but we do know that there were major benefits for a longer tail of grantees and that it exceeded our expectations despite bugs, and we think it\u2019s worth trying again before we drastically change course.\nVote\n\nVoting\n\nThe forum post outlined three options \u2013 to continue with the cap at 2.5%, to continue with the cap at a different percentage (as proposed by the community), or a completely new community-led proposal, should anyone want to put a new structure forth. \nDuring the period the forum post was up, we did not receive any specific proposals for different percentages or structures to try in GR13.\n\nAs a result, we are structuring the vote as follows:\n\nFOR: Repeat main pool with 2.5% cap\n\nStick to exactly what we did in GR12.\n\nNo individual grant\u2019s matching contribution amount shall exceed 2.5% of the overall matching pool fund (i.e., $30K of the $1.2M pool).\n\n\nAGAINST: Alternate proposal\n\nSelect this option if you have an alternate proposal you would like to table.

Unfortunately, there are several users who were eligible for the drop because they funded the project Force DAO before the cut-off date for the airdrop. However, due to an error in the transaction validator these users were unable to claim their tokens. Specifically, when these users went to claim their tokens within the 30-day airdrop window, they were not allocated a percent of GTC tokens for their donations to Force DAO. After speaking with users and investigating online, it seems that those transactions were incorrectly dropped before the airdrop period. After some of these users reported it, they eventually had their transactions re-added, but after the cut-off date. This proposal is looking to retroactively compensate those users who were not able to claim their GTC due to the error. \n\nWe will compensate the users linked below. All these users have demonstrated the necessary proof to be eligible for the airdrop and were responsive throughout the proposal process. We had two criteria in order to show eligible proof:\n\n1) Proof of original donation which meets the original airdrop requirements\n2) Proof of an attempted claim during the original airdrop period\n\nIf passed, we wish to distribute the specified amount (view linked pdf for exact amounts) through WhalerDAO\u2019s Astro-Drop.

During the GR11 Finale Event this overall strategy was questioned by Vitalik Buterin, the argument being Quadratic Funding should be just as effective during Grant Rounds using no categories.\n\nDuring GR12, the Public Goods Funding workstream wants to test Vitalik\u2019s theory that Quadratic Funding should be as effective at allocating funds as allocation via categories. By doing away with specific grant categories and having all grants listed together, we hope to simplify and decentralize matching. This is a radical change in how we\u2019ve historically set matching funds for grants\u2019 matching pools, but a challenge we believe will help to better understand how to best implement Quadratic Funding.\n\n\n[The forum post](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gitcoin-gr12-matching-pool-allocations/9007/24) outlines the above in more detail \u2013- and this Snapshot vote will decide if and how we test this approach in GR12.\n\nVote\n\nThe three options to vote on are:\n\nOption 1: Single Pool Experiment\n\nUse GR12 as a test case to run an experiment whereby we do away with categories.\n\nThe GR12 main pool will be a single matching pool fund/distribution of $1,000,000 in matching for the round. No individual grant\u2019s matching contribution amount shall exceed 2.5% of the overall matching pool fund (i.e., $25k)\n\nPros: We get to run a proper experiment and try out a new approach to funding\n\nCons: The experiment is an unknown vs. our tried & trusted categories\n\n\nOption 2: No experiment\n\nStick with the same category-based approach we\u2019ve been using in the past \u2013 specifically, run GR12 with the same categories as GR11.\n\nPros: Less uncertainty (rinse & repeat prior round approach)\nCons: We remain in the dark as to how a Single Pool might perform\n\n \nOption 3: Do a 50/50\n\nRun 50% of the matching pot as a single pool experiment, and 50% category-based as before.\n\nThis option was proposed in response to the governance proposal that outlined Option 1. This was proposed as a \u2018happy medium\u2019 \u2013 going more gradually vs. doing a full-on experiment in GR12.\n\nPros: We get to experiment a bit while maintaining the category approach for half the pool\nCons: Having both at once is more complex and potentially very confusing for grantees", "choices": ["Single Pool Experiment", "No experiment", "Do a 50/50"], "start": 1637613000, "end": 1638217800, "snapshot": "13666591", "state": "closed", "author": "0x7E052Ef7B4bB7E5A45F331128AFadB1E589deaF1", "space": {"id": "gitcoindao.eth", "name": "Gitcoin"}}, {"id": "0x4efcc747d7eee626a42e23bea82826964a5753295ae77c8514301711248e28c6", "title": "Why the price of GTC is lower than RAD?", "body": "", "choices": ["Gitcoin is working hard ", "Radicle is marketing hard"], "start": 1637596800, "end": 1638244800, "snapshot": "13665598", "state": "closed", "author": "0x46Ac0c9c530Dc960A4Df75b20B594fbA243E5b7C", "space": {"id": "gitcoindao.eth", "name": "Gitcoin"}}, {"id": "0xf206afbc1021d710f548d0414d6caaa752c375c025c7e397607d990f3d946f69", "title": "Does GTC need more function?", "body": "", "choices": ["yes", "no"], "start": 1637553600, "end": 1637899200, "snapshot": "13662693", "state": "closed", "author": "0x9C2Fd95e1B8BD9BE5612700B0b29C893FEa417E1", "space": {"id": "gitcoindao.eth", "name": "Gitcoin"}}, {"id": "0x265fe70790524875caacb6675ef6d10b4d4ceac8b1c26df26ad1ba284eab70a1", "title": "Request to fund FDD workstream Q4 2021 budget", "body": "Request to send 76,500 GTC to the FDD-WG multisig to fund their Q4 2021 budget.

Especially science and software libraries public goods suffer severe underfunding when funding quadratic, because every funder cannot know every science topic.\n\n* When doing quadratic funding it inevitably goes much random - some projects are funded too much and some are severely underfunded (among other reasons, because well-funded projects can buy SEO of their ads).\n\n* Anti-sybil is improving but it can\u2019t be perfect.\n\n* If some important text or software is buried on the 100000th position of Google, the world gets stuck: nobody knows that the missing component is a problem and therefore nobody fixes the problem.\n\nSo, we need a much more objective mean of funding.

This was posted on June 1st as a [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/avsa/status/1399892313007083522?s=21) and gathered some positive feedback from many of the community representatives.\n\n## The issue with the two main proposals\n\n* There's not enough market depth to liquidate all Akita tokens without losing a lot of value for Gitcoin. Even if there are serious doubts about the long term viability of the Akita community, we have a responsibility to maximize the value gained for Gitcoin. \n* Locking Akita on Sablier doesn't put that capital to good use, and if the market crashes and recovers and crashes again during before the stream is over, then there was a missed opportunity.\n\n\n## The Proposed Implementation\n\n1) Sell 10% of Akita in any exchange, put it in the Gitcoin treasury\n2) Sell yet another 10% into ETH. \n3) Create a Scheduled Balancer pool with the 10% ETH obtained in step 2 and all the remaining Akita.\n4) Set up the pool controller to programmatically change the ratio over a period P so that it inverts from a 10% ETH 90% AKITA into a 90% ETH and 10% AKITA\n5) After period is over, the community can decide what to do with the remaining tokens. \n\nThose types of pools are usually called **Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools** and are often used to launch new tokens that don't have liquidity. In this case, the token has launched but it would still bootstrap the liquidity. You can read more about LBPs on this article about [Radicle](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/radicles-new-record-lbp-sale-shows-that-lbps-are-here-to-stay-4c81e15a4d4d).\n\nTo make sure the market doesn't dump immediately, we could do step 1 and 2 using [Gnosis Auctions](https://blog.gnosis.pm/announcing-gnosis-auction-launch-390124d56248): this would take off some buy pressure immediately and then make sure the starting price of the LBP is closer to what other market makers have.\n\n\n## The end result is that:\n* At the end of the period, Gitcoin will have sold most of their Akita, at a fairer market price, similarly to a Dollar Cost Averaging strategy\n* Akita community gets a much more liquid market, a \"billion\" dollars deep (emphasis on the air quotes). This will reduce the impact any single seller can have on the final price.\n* All trades that are executed against this pool will earn fees for Gitcoin, so in periods of high volatility Gitcoin is leveraging its massive Akita Holdings to generate Yield\n* There will be a constant sell pressure on Akita, but it's one that is scheduled and known\n\n\n## Variants and Risks\n\nBalancer Pools are quite flexible and we could do other options like having a pool that starts at 91% Akita, 3% GTC, 3% ETH and 3% DAI. Or we could add all the dog tokens into a big billion dollar pile of dog ~~poo~~ money.\n\nPools also don't necessarily need to be locked: we can add a smart controller so that Gitcoin DAO can accelerate the schedule at a later vote, or simply change it completely and use the [Pie DAO](https://medium.com/piedao/introducing-pie-smart-pools-85a77a2dc22e) so that ratios can be changed at the will of GTC holders. Also, at any point, Gitcoin could vote to take the liquidity out of its own pool and receive it in either token of the pool.\n\nIt's also important to note that **LBPs are different than just selling a token**: the pool wants to keep a constant ratio at all times to reach its target, be it 10%, 25% or 90%. So it means that *the pool will both sell and buy akita for ETH* to keep the target ratio\u2013that's how AMMs work. A LBP changes that target ratio slowly over time, but it also is reacting to the market in real time. It means that, if akita drops to near 0, then the pool will automatically be buying akita with ETH until it reaches the desired balance, so almost ETH would be drained from the pool. But that ETH came from the Akita sale in the step 2, and the end result would be the same if the strategy was to stream or liquidate it anyway. On the other hand, if the market goes up again, that will mean the pool will start selling the cheap akita it bought back to ETH (plus the fees it got during the period) which is why pools make money from volatility. \n\nDisclaimer: I work for Balancer labs, but if the community wants to they can use other solutions.

Each one, seemingly, have somewhat contradictory mandates. This is because there have not been standards and processes put in place as of yet that establish \"what occurs in scenario X if Y\", i.e. \"what occurs when two contradictory votes pass, prior to execution of the first?\" (double jeopardy, to some extent).\n\n# Proposal\nThis proposal is rather meta. It is a proposal to begin a set of proposals to set standards and processes that proposers must follow to ensure validity and enforce-ability. We should set rules for issues such as:\n- Double Jeopardy\n- Proposal Parameter Validity (start time, end time, start block, etc)\n- Proposal Process Validity (template, forum -> snapshot -> onchain?)\n- etc.\n\n# Prior Art\nYam was the first to establish a number of rules that we can look at for how to potentially impose standards for off-chain voting. Many protocols have followed since (some better than others). Yam established rules for what is considered a valid off-chain vote, specifying:\n1. Start date: must always be in the future, and have some amount of time (t+6hrs) from creation of the vote\n2. End date: must run for x amount of time\n3. Start block: must be within x minutes of vote start time\n\nAny vote that does not meet said criteria would be considered invalid and potentially censored from snapshot by controllers of the associated ENS. What I like about the above benchmarks for standards is that in general, most spammers won't follow the above and can be weeded out quickly and easily as well as ensuring fairness/time to prepare for votes, killing two birds with one stone.\n", "choices": ["Yes, begin standards creation", "No, potential for censorship"], "start": 1622581200, "end": 1622840400, "snapshot": "12550900", "state": "closed", "author": "0x683A78bA1f6b25E29fbBC9Cd1BFA29A51520De84", "space": {"id": "gitcoindao.eth", "name": "Gitcoin"}}, {"id": "QmZeogNXZPuLj3LMW9bZ6AGHdsxhBpvmiKCwMyagTsuLWV", "title": "Multi-language support \uff08\u5173\u4e8e\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u652f\u6301\u7684\u63d0\u6848\uff09", "body": "Hello community, I'm new to gitcoin and the future this community envisions is particularly fascinating, it's a new world of freedom for me.\nLikewise, there must be many new people from all over the world joining in like me, and I think it's time for the community to consider supporting multiple languages, so that more people from more regions can join in and make the community even more DAO.\n\nSuggestions for supporting multiple languages.\n1. the official forum to add multi-language entrance, friends from different regions choose to enter their own language directory to participate in the discussion, similar to the directory function.
